# cwipc_orbbec

This project has software for capturing point clouds using Orbbec depth
cameras. The software turns Orbbec depth and color frames into cwipc
pointclouds.

It is usually built or installed as part of the _cwipc_ suite, <https://github.com/cwi-dis/cwipc>.

When installed it enables the use of Orbbec Femto Mega cameras in cwipc. Other models may work but
this has not been tested.

This module requires the [Orbbec SDK v2](https://github.com/orbbec/OrbbecSDK_v2) SDK to be installed.

See the toplevel [_cwipc_ readme file](../readme.md) for more information.
